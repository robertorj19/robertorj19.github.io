            <h3>Discord Discbot bot</h3>
            <p>Discogs Discord Bot A cross-language Discord bot built with JavaScript and Python that fetches detailed record information from the Discogs database. By integrating both the Discord and Discogs APIs, the bot allows users to query vinyl releases, artists, and catalog data directly from chat. Designed for music collectors and crate diggers, it delivers fast, formatted responses with a clean command structure and robust error handling</p>

            <h3>Collabrative Spotify playlist generator.</h3>
            <p>Tired of arguing with who gets the aux at a party I built a bot that turns music selection into a game. This collaborative Spotify playlist generator lets groups vote on songs in real time, creating a shared playlist democratically — and with a competitive twist. Using Spotify’s API and custom logic in JavaScript and Python, the bot tracks votes, ranks tracks, and updates the playlist dynamically. Whether you're hosting a party or curating a road trip soundtrack.</p>

            <h3>Comic book reccomender system</h3>
            <p>Built as my final-year dissertation, this project is a full-stack AI-powered web application designed to introduce users to comic books they didn’t know they’d love. I engineered a custom weighted recommendation algorithm in Java, trained on curated comic metadata and user preference patterns. From data selection and preprocessing to backend logic, I developed the entire pipeline — integrating a secure login system, a relational database, and a responsive frontend to deliver personalized suggestions. The system emphasizes discovery over popularity, surfacing hidden gems based on nuanced taste profiles. Available to view upon request.</p>
